# roster-ready

## Description

This Repository contains the files and code to run a program that takes user input through the command line and generates a pre-styled html file displaying your team members! It will prompt you for a manager and as many engineers and interns as you like! Now you can keep track of all your current team members in a quick to display method. Throughout this build i learned alot about using the inquirer package and incorporating prompts into conditional logic. 

## Installation
To run this application you must install inquirer and jest to run the tests. They are already listed as dependencies so the command to run would be "npm i"

## Usage
To initialize this app in the command line from the roster folder, run the command "node index.js"
Here is a link to a walkthrough video of the apps functionality and passing tests:
